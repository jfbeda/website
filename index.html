		<h2>About</h2> 

		<p>
			Hello!
		</p>
		<p>
			I am Jack Beda. I currently study MPhys Mathematical Physics (5 years) at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland in my 5th and final year. I grew up in Peterborough, Ontario, Canada. Primarily, this website is a side project to help me learn HTML and Javascript when I have little better to do, but you may find some useful information here regardless. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			I am a keen mountaineer, canoeist, physicist, mathematician, language learner, and lover of good food and conversation. Head over to the <a href="outdooring.html">Outdooring</a> tab to see some pretty pictures or the <a href="research.html">Research Projects</a> tab to read about the various research work I have done. For a list of the classes I have taken while at the University of Edinburgh, see the <a href="academics.html">Academics</a> tab. If you're interested in chatting in a particular language, head over to the <a href="academics.html">Languages</a> tab to see if we can try to have a conversation. I would love to hear from you, so please do get in contact via the <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> page or, if you know me already, please just come and say hi.
		</p>


		<p>	
			Have a very nice day!
		</p>
